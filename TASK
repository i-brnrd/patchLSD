### Marco Wittman's Patch Foraging task


Work in progress; would be nice if instructions can be added in here to


## Training

### Training A:
10 trials of
    length matched blue (15); pause, then red (15)

### Training B:
3 x
    3 repeats (?) of a full blue patch; i.e rew2ld + stay.

### Training C:
18 trials of task + POINTS displayed (fixed pattern)



## Task:
90 trials drawn from data provided by Marco.

Each trial is

Blue patch for 15/16/17 events.

Events are reward or non reward (drawn from Marco's task data*)

Leave-Stay Decision

Either

-Stay in Blue patch

-Leave for Red patch (default)

Each quarter of experiment, subjects recieve feedback about Bonus Points- done

60% of trials were truncated after the LSD- done?

We need to decide whether orders of these should be fixed or not and



* Patches drawn from same reward rate curve must not be presented concurrently
