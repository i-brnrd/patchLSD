## Participant Instructions
We are interested in how people learn and make decisions.

In this experiment, you will collect rewards in different (virtual) environments and **compare them** to determine which offers more rewards. We are also interested in how you **predict** future rewards in each environment.

**What should you do?** Imagine you are a treasure hunter, who aims to collect as much gold as possible in different environments, like a cave, jungle, desert, etc. The hunter may develop a sense of how abundant treasures are in each place. And based on this, they will decide whether to stay in an environment or leave for another one. What we ask you to do in this experiment is similar.

In this experiment, your search through an environment is represented by pressing the spacebar when you see a fixation cross. Each button press represents a search step, leading to one of two outcomes: finding a treasure chest filled with gold or encountering an empty chest. The next figure will illustrate this process.

### Comparison training (A)

In this first training session, you will search for rewards in two environments: a stable red one and a changing blue environment. The red environment consistently provides the same amount of gold, while the changing blue environment varies each time you enter. Your goal is to choose the changing environment if it offers more gold than the red one, and to stick with the red environment when it is the better choice.

During the training, you will first navigate the changing environment (blue) and then the stable one (red). Focus on how much gold you collect in each (no need to count, just get a sense of it). At the end, you will be asked which environment yielded more gold, and you can respond by clicking with the mouse once the question mark disappears:

After your response, you will receive feedback. If you select the better environment, you will earn **Bonus Points** based on how much more gold you collected. If you choose the lesser environment, we will show you the Bonus Points you missed.

This training consists of 3 sequences comparing the red environment with others. Both environments will require the same number of button presses, so pay attention to how much you earn in the red environment and how long it takes to navigate it, as this information will be useful later in the main experiment.

Pay attention to the red environment since you will need to make decisions about it later without seeing it again.

### Drift training (B)

As mentioned above, the changing environment is different every time you enter. Although the colour is always blue, each environment is unique. The changing environment also "drifts" as you navigate it—some drift significantly, while others are more stable, changing either rapidly or slowly but always in a systematic way.

To illustrate, think of a treasure hunter who constantly assesses the value of locations for finding gold. Deserts and mountains are vastly different places and will have changing amounts of gold. Your task is to explore various changing environments and observe how they improve or decline.

Remember that the amount of gold you collect depends on the **frequency and magnitudes** of the rewards. This means how often you receive rewards changes over time, but also how much reward you receive every time. Either an environment gets better overall, or it gets worse. However, this can happen in a quick or in a slow way, it can change a lot, or it can change only very subtly.

### Prediction Training (C)

It is time to focus on predicting the enviroments’ future rewards. This prediction task is more complex than simple comparisons and will mirror what you will do in the main experiment.

Using the treasure hunter analogy, imagine searching a cave where you initially find little gold but later discover more. You might feel you are on the right track! If you come across an exit leading to a jungle (the red environment), your decision to stay in the cave or move to the jungle depends on your expectations about future rewards. You might stay if you believe more treasures lie ahead or leave if you think you have exhausted the cave’s potential.

In the Prediction Training, you will start in a changing environment. After a period, you will have to make a “stay/leave” decision. If you choose to stay, you continue searching for gold in the blue changing environment. If you leave, you will switch to the red stable environment. Your goal is to predict which option will yield more rewards overall.

It is essential to remember how much gold you earn in the red environment and how long it takes to navigate it. After your decision, you will receive feedback about its quality. Good decisions earn **Bonus Points** based on the difference in gold collected between the two environments. If your choice is not optimal, you will see how many points you missed.

Also, please use the instances you decide to leave for the red environment to “refresh” your knowledge how good it is there, as you will not be able to do that so often in the main experiment. This is because in the actual experiment, we will sometimes not show you what is happening after the stay/leave decision.

***Two last things.***

You now understand the red environment's value and duration and how to decide whether to leave the changing environment for it. Keep in mind that some phases after your stay/leave decision will be cut off during the actual experiment, and this will occur randomly, unrelated to your choices. It is crucial to take these decisions seriously, as your decision-making is at the core of this study.

Note that this study does NOT involve deception of any kind! There is no “hidden” thing about your behaviour in which we are interested. We are interested in the decisions about stay/leave you make and there is no simple “trick” what you should choose. What you should do is to always pay close attention to the changing environments and strive to make the best decision for each situation.
